<p>But since you're here lets learn about a town never built to survive. <strong>Survival Town, Nevada</strong>. The Civil Defense Apple-2 shot on 5 May 1955 was intended to test various building construction types in a nuclear blast. An assortment of buildings, including residential houses and electrical substations, were constructed at the site nicknamed "Survival Town". The buildings were populated with mannequins, and stocked with different types of canned and packaged foods. Not all of the buildings were destroyed in the blast, and some of them still stand at Area 1, Nevada Test Site. A short film about the blast, referred to as "Operation Cue", was distributed by the Federal Civil Defense Administration. The houses are still standing at 34.04476°N 116.07416°W, at the east and west ends of the road loop. They are stops on the NNSS tour.</p>
