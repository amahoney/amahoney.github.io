<h1>Ghost Towns of the World</h1>
<p>I am a designer in Ottawa with experience in <strong>UI/UX  design </strong> and a fascination in <strong>way-finding</strong>. The main link between these fields is their ability to facilitate  interaction and navigation. I love to inspire curiosity and simplify the complications of life. I believe that <strong>design comes first</strong> and by working with a variety of clients I can help them adopt this ideology to their benefit.
